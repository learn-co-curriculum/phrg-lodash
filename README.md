# Nitro JS - Lodash

Nitro uses a variety of JS libraries to make the magic happen. But there is no JS library more commonly `import`ed in Nitro than [`lodash`](https://lodash.com/).

Originally released in 2012, `lodash` is a light weight JS library made up of utility functions for common programming tasks. As you review its API, you may notice a lot of the functions look and operate similar to Ruby methods, such as `compact`, `sortBy`, and `values`.

Nitro imports functions from `lodash` in over 500 separate places (and counting). Listed below are commonly used `lodash` functions in Nitro, linked to `lodash`'s documentation.

Lodash docs are clear and concise. Each function has an **interactive** set of examples attached to it. For each of these functions, read the documentation and play with the examples.

You are encouraged to use `lodash` in the upcoming JS Project.
